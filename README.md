# Apollo 11 Moon Landing Animation

## Description
The grainy footage of the Apollo 11 landing is very possibly one of my earliest memories: I remember my granny calling at me to come and watch Neil Armstrong bouncing almost weightlessly on lunar soil; I imagine it must have been in the news. I was almost two and, although I'd no concept of the significance of what I was witnessing, for some reason it made quite an impression on me. 'Astronaut' was added to my, very modest at the time, vocabulary in July 1969 and what it stands for still fascinates me, half a century on. On 19 July 2019, I felt I had to register somehow this enduring fascination &ndash; hence this quickly coded, simple animation.
